# Steganography-Secret-Message-Encoding-in-BMP-Files
This project implements steganography to encode secret messages within BMP images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method. The encoding subtly alters pixel data without changing the imageâ€™s appearance, ensuring undetectable alterations. It also supports decoding the hidden message, enabling secure communication.
